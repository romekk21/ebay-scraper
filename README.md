# Project Summary
The eBay web scraper is a simple Python tool that gathers the titles of the 600 most recently sold items of a search result on eBay per execution. Currently, the web scraper parses through the titles of the sold items of the search result “Vintage T Shirt.” Every word found in a title is stored and counted in an Excel document for easy data analysis, along with the month of the sale. This web scraper provides a much more versatile and detailed approach to analyzing sales on eBay than what is given to the user on eBay’s website. 
# Libraries Used
- [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Web scraper used to gather the data from eBay. 
- [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Used to read and write the Excel file where the data is ultimately stored.
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Used to get user input. 
# Goals of the Project/Why is this useful
- The primary goal of this project is to analyze eBay sold product data in order to better understand what types of products to list, specifically in second-hand T-Shirt market.
- Although eBay gives a lot of information about the number of themes that were sold, the available themes to sort by are too general. Furthermore, the format that the data comes in makes it impossible to do deeper analysis with time trends and bar graphs.
