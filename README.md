# Project Summary
The eBay web scraper is a simple Python tool that gathers the titles of the 600 most recently sold items of a search result on eBay per execution. Currently, the web scraper parses through the titles of the sold items of the search result “Vintage T Shirt.” Every word found in a title is stored and counted in an Excel document for easy data analysis, along with the month of the sale. This web scraper provides a much more versatile and detailed approach to analyzing sales on eBay than what is given to the user on eBay’s website.
